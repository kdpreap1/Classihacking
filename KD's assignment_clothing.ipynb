This is a crucial aspect of machine learning, as it allows us to get a realistic estimate of the model's performance on new, unseen data. Standardizing separately also helps to mimic the real-world scenario, where the model will be applied to new, unseen data, and we want it to perform well on that data, not just on the training data."

We one-by-one add an additional sample to our positive samples, noting down the attendant classifier's TPR and FPR and threshold. We now also note down the percentage of our list of samples predicted as positive. Remember we start from the mostest positive, where the percentage labelled as positive would be minuscule, like 0.1 or so and the threshold like a 0.99 in probability or so. As we decrease the threshold, the percentage predicted to be positive clearly increases until everything is predicted positive at a threshold of 0. What we now do is, at each such additional sample/threshold (given to us by the `roc_curve` function from `sklearn`), we calculate the expected profit per person and plot it against the percentage predicted positive by that threshold to produce a profit curve. Thus, small percentages correspond to samples most likely to be positive: a percentage of 8% means the top 8% of our samples ranked by likelihood of being positive.\n",

    "* We examine the profit curve for each classifier to identify the range of thresholds where profit is achieved. This graph demonstrates the amount of profit we should anticipate across various thresholds. When the graph is positioned above the x-axis (representing zero profit), it indicates that we are achieving a profit. Therefore, the interval of thresholds in which the curve is higher than the x-axis is the point at which we are generating profit. If we observe that the profit curve rises above the x-axis, between 20% and 70% on the x-axis, it therefore shows that we are profitable within that range of thresholds. Hence, profits are generated within the threshold range of 20% to 70%. In conclusion, we examine the profit curve, and any point above the x-axis indicates profitability. Therefore, the point at which we are profitable is within the range of thresholds where the curve remains higher than the specified line."
